# Fyra Labs

We're a startup that produces cutting-edge, open-source technology for a better future.
While we work in a variety of fields, our current focus is currently within the Linux ecosystem.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects

All of our products and projects are open source. Our primary projects are:

- [tauOS](https://github.com/tau-OS), a next-generation desktop operating system, converging human-centric design, seamless syncing capabilities, and an unbreakable core with everything you know and love about Linux.
- [Chisel Operator](https://github.com/FyraLabs/chisel-operator), a Kubernetes service which bridges applications to the outside world using [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) tunnels, yes, even behind NAT. Originally made as an alternative to [Inlets](https://inlets.dev), after they moved to a closed model. 
- [Terra](https://github.com/terrapkg), a high-quality community repository for Fedora, providing 1000+ essential packages not provided in the main repositories.
- [Ultramarine Linux](https://github.com/Ultramarine-Linux), a Fedora distribution with pragmatic defaults that get out of your way, so you can focus on what's important to you.

## üöÄ Community

The Fyra community is more than just Fyra Labs. Our community (which includes us) is primary active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5fdPuxTg5Q) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#hub:fyralabs.com).
We also have accounts on [Mastodon/Fediverse](https://fedi.fyralabs.com/@hq) and [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/teamfyralabs) for those who want an easy feed to follow updates on.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Contributing

### Code

All of our code is open and developed by the community. Have a feature or bug that you'd like to work on? Go for it. While we primarily track development on our GitHub issues, we also discuss development in our chats, so please join those too.

### Translations

We want to offer our projects in as many languages as possible. You can help us localize on our [Weblate](https://weblate.fyralabs.com), a service that lets you translate our software, without having to get into the weeds of the code.
